# retro-tts

1. Turn a sentence into lingustic features i.e. phonemes and duration
2. Process lingustic features to vocoder features i.e. cepstra, spectrogram, fundamental frequency
3. Generate audio

## Text to Phonemes

## Phonemes to Vocoder Features

* Consider triphones for past and future context

### Prosody

Prosody refers to certain properties of speech such as changes in pitch,
loudness and syllable length. It can also include stresses, and speech rate.
Prosodic events are time-aligned with syllables or groups of syllables instead
of segments (sounds, phonemes) so are referred to as suprasegmental phenomena -
or suprasegmentals.

It can be represented as follows:

* Acoustic level - the representation of it in sound waves. Frequency, duraion, amplitude.
* Perceptual level - how a person hears it 
* Lingustic level - the functional analysis of prosody by a lingust - more descriptive of prosody

## SpeedySpeech

There is also support for loading a pre-trained speedy speech model where we load it via candle. To
do this download the latest SpeedySpeech mode as so:

```
wget -O models/speedyspeech.pth \
    https://github.com/janvainer/speedyspeech/releases/download/v0.2/speedyspeech.pth 
```
